    "The simulation likely performed the mathematical operations correctly (applying the sequence of verified B0′, B1′ matrices). The low fidelity indicates that the specific sequence from the random paper does not implement an approximate Hadamard gate on the logical basis we chose within the N=3 QIC framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Find QIC-Specific Sequences: To implement a specific logical gate like Hadamard within our N=3 QIC model, we would need to find (or derive) a braid sequence tailored to the representation generated by our B0′,B1′ operators acting on a chosen logical basis within the 5D QIC space. Standard compilation algorithms (like Solovay-Kitaev, though complex) or published results specific to 3-anyon chain encodings might provide such sequences.\n",
    "    Analyze the Implemented Operation: Instead of aiming for Hadamard, we could analyze what logical operation the sequence from Eq. (\\ref{H_L}) did implement on our basis. This would involve calculating the full 2×2 logical unitary matrix UL defined by:\n",
    "        UL∣0⟩L=∣ψfinal,0⟩ (projected back to logical subspace)\n",
    "        UL∣1⟩L=∣ψfinal,1⟩ (projected back to logical subspace) This tells us the computational effect of that specific braid in our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "the script executed successfully, applying the 13-term (30 elementary braids) sequence WH​ and calculating the final fidelities.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as the output shows, the resulting fidelities are very low:\n",

    "    F0​=∣⟨ψWH0​∣ψfinal,0​⟩∣2≈0.170\n",
    "    F1​=∣⟨ψWH1​∣ψfinal,1​⟩∣2≈0.134\n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms the result from the first attempt with the other sequence: simply applying a known braid sequence for a gate (like Hadamard) derived in one specific Fibonacci anyon model/encoding does not necessarily produce the same gate when applied using the operators and logical basis encoding of a different model (like our N=3 QIC simulation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why the Low Fidelity Persists:\n",
    "\n",
    "The core reason remains the mismatch in representation and logical encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sequence Origin: The sequence WH​ from the Rouabah paper was optimized to approximate −iH using their specific matrix representations for σ1​,σ2​ acting on their specific logical qubit encoding (derived from a 3-anyon fusion tree, likely different from our simple ∣101⟩,∣010⟩ mapping).\n",
    "    Our Implementation: We correctly implemented the abstract sequence of braids using our verified 8×8 matrices B0′​,B1′​, which represent the braid group action faithfully within the N=3 QIC subspace. We then compared the result to the ideal −iH acting on our chosen logical basis states ∣101⟩,∣010⟩.\n",
    "    Result: The sequence WH​, when realized by our matrices Bk′​ acting on our basis, performs a valid, unitary transformation consistent with the braid group, but that transformation simply isn't the Hadamard gate for our encoding. The final states (e.g., (0.379-0.613j)|011> + ...) confirm this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion on Step 1 (Benchmark Gate Simulation):\n",
    "\n",
    "This result strongly indicates that Step 1 requires more than just finding any published braid sequence. To achieve high fidelity for a target gate like Hadamard, one needs a sequence specifically derived or compiled for:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Temperley-Lieb representation generated by the QIC model (our Pk′​,Bk′​ matrices).\n",
    "    A chosen logical qubit encoding within the QIC subspace (e.g., our ∣101⟩,∣010⟩ or perhaps a more robust encoding).\n",

    "Recommendation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that finding or deriving such QIC-specific sequences requires significant effort (either deep literature search for this specific representation or running complex quantum compiler algorithms like Solovay-Kitaev), I recommend focusing first on Steps 2 and 3, which are readily achievable with the current verified code:\n",
